# Animal Complaints in Brisbane Data Analytics Project

This repo contains the Animal Complaints Project for the Data Analytics with Python Course.

## Structure of the Project Report

### 1. Overview

The project investigated the animal complaints received by the Brisbane City Council (BCC), and reported quarterly, over the two year period ending September 2020. The project aimed to identify trends and insights with an initial focus on total complaints, complaints by suburb, complaints as a % of suburb population and also dig into 'attack' types and 'animal wandering' reporting level complaints. 

### 2. Data Used (located separately in google drive)

All data is available at the following google drive link. It contains 3 folders as follows:
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aWxBN4eoFGGi9rfpn-yRo4ZwKpETKg0M?usp=sharing

   #### a. Source Data. This includes two sources:
    
   i) Brisbane City Council (BCC) animal complaints received by quarter from Oct-2018 to Sept-2020
    
   ii) Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) suburb population Census data 2016

   #### b. Cleaned Data
    
   This is is the data resulting from the cleaning process used for the Analysis
    
   #### c. Discarded Source Data. 
    
   This includes a BCC community builder Local Government Area suburb population break down for Brisbane which was originally used for suburb match but proved unsuccessful.


### 3. Cleaning Process and Code
- Data Gathering (process outlined in project_summary notebook in report folder)
- Data Compiling (process outlined in project_summary notebook in report folder)
- Data Cleaning (code used can be seen in the cleaning_inc_initial_analysis notebook in the code folder)
- Analysis Preparation (code used can be seen in the analysis_workings notebook folder in the code folder)
    
    
### 4. Results - Questions and Analysis
The analysis contained with the project_summary notebook in the report folder addresses the following questions:

- Which suburbs received the highest and lowest total number of complaints?

- Do the suburbs with the highest and lowest total complaint numbers change based on relative % of suburb population size?

- Which suburb has had the most 'attack' complaint types over the 2-year period and how did this compare as percentage of their population?

- Are total 'attack' complaints increasing or decreasing over the last 2 years?

- How do the distributions of total complaints by suburb and suburb populations compare?

- How do the distributions of % total complaints by suburb and % attack complaints by suburb compare?

- How do the distributions of total complaints by suburb and % complaints by suburb compare?

- What is the most common animal complaint type?

- What is the most common complaint 'reporting level' and which suburb has the most occurrences?

- Which suburb had the most fox complaints reported over the 2-year period?

- Are total animal complaints increasing or decreasing over the last 2 years, and did they change over the most recent 6-month period when more people were likely to be at home during the week due to Covid-19?


### 5. Visualisations Supporting the Analysis
A number of visualisations are included to support the analysis. These are contained within the project_summary notebook in the report folder. 


### 6. Conclusion
Total reported animal complaints in the Brisbane Local Government Area increased over the 2 year period ending September 2020. Dogs unsurprisingly receive the most complaints of all animal types making up 45% of the total 17,072 complaints received over the 2 years. The suburb of Inala recorded the highest number of reported complaints over the period with 563.

The project_summary notebook in the report folder provides a range of additional conclusions on quarterly trends, complaints & complaint reporting level breakdowns, key suburbs for complaints, comparative complaint rates versus suburb population sizes, and fox complaints. Interestingly, there were 777 fox complaints reported over the 2 year period with the suburb of Tarragindi reported the highest number with 35. 


### 7. Future Work
The report identifies 4 potential areas to expand and improve the analysis.
